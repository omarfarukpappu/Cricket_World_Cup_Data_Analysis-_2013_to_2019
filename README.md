# Cricket_World_Cup_Data_Analysis-_2013_to_2019
## I will show you how to use Power BI to analyze Cricket World Cup data from 2013 to 2019. We will start by importing the dataset into Power BI and cleaning and shaping the data to make it ready for analysis. Then, we will create various visualizations using Power BI's powerful tools to gain insights into the performance of different teams and players over the years.
We will cover various aspects of the Cricket World Cup, including batting, bowling, fielding, and overall team performance. Using Power BI, we will create interactive dashboards that allow us to drill down into specific aspects of the data and gain a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns.
